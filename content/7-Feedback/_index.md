# Evaluation and Feedback on the Internship Program

## I. General Evaluation

### 1. Working Environment
The working environment at **AWS First Cloud Journey (FCJ)** is genuinely open. More than just a workplace, FCJ feels like a miniature tech community. The workshops and networking sessions not only helped me update my knowledge but also provided opportunities to connect with experienced seniors in the field.

### 2. Mentor / Team Admin Support
I am particularly impressed with the Mentor's guidance method. Instead of giving direct answers, the Mentor patiently listened to the team's workflow and ideas, then suggested various **options**. This approach not only helped us solve immediate problems but also broadened our perspectives, forcing us to think critically to select the optimal solution. Support from the Team Admin regarding documentation and processes was also very timely, allowing me to focus maximally on professional tasks.

### 3. Alignment with Major (AI vs. Cloud)
As an AI major venturing into Cloud, I initially faced quite a few barriers. However, the system of documentation, practical Labs, and detailed video tutorials provided by the program helped me catch up quickly. The project work helped me realize the symbiotic relationship between AI and Cloud: Cloud provides the infrastructure for AI to scale, and AI brings intelligent value to applications on the Cloud.

### 4. Learning & Skill Development
The biggest highlight in my learning process was the 3-session **AWS Cloud Mastery Series**. Although these sessions took place when our team's project was in its final stages, the knowledge gained here helped us optimize our architecture and reduce operating costs by **4-5 times** compared to the original design. This was a real-world lesson in Cost Optimization that is hard to learn from books alone.

### 5. Culture & Team Spirit
The culture of respect and straightforwardness helped our team overcome initial phases of conflict to coordinate more smoothly. Everyone was ready to share difficulties and support each other's tasks to reach the finish line together.

## II. Survey & Proposals

### 1. What did you like most about this internship program?
What I like most is the harmonious combination of learning and practical application. The program not only provides foundational knowledge but also creates opportunities to apply it immediately to real projects with close guidance from Mentors. This helped me not only understand the theory but also know how to apply it in a corporate environment.

### 2. What do you think the company needs to improve?
Although the training program is excellent, I noticed there isn't much in-depth orientation content for those switching majors (e.g., a specific roadmap for AI/Data students wanting to specialize as Cloud Architects). If there were additional sessions sharing about **Career Paths**, I think it would be very useful for future cohorts.

### 3. Proposals & Desires
* **Regarding the product:** I am well aware that the SorcererXtreme project is not yet perfect (security is not yet tight, some edge cases haven't been handled). I hope to have the opportunity to continue receiving reviews and feedback from Mentors to refine this product even after the internship has ended.

Finally, I would like to send my sincere thanks to the entire FCJ team for creating such a meaningful and beneficial internship program. This internship not only helped me develop professional skills but also expanded my vision regarding my future career path. I look forward to continuing to accompany and develop with AWS in the journey ahead.
