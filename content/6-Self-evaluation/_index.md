# Internship Self-Evaluation Report

## 1. Internship Overview
The internship journey at **AWS First Cloud Journey** (from **September 4, 2025** to **November 28, 2025**) was a significant milestone. It not only helped me acquire new knowledge and skills but also allowed me to gain practical combat experience in a corporate environment.

In the role of an intern, I had the opportunity to team up and participate in developing the project **"SorcererXtreme" (Huyền Thuật AI)**. This was not just a coding opportunity but a chance for me to delve deep into the Cloud Computing ecosystem. Specifically, I have:
* **Frontend Development:** Built modern, user-experience-optimized (UX/UI) interfaces using **Next.js** combined with **Tailwind CSS**.
* **Serverless Backend Construction:** Designed and deployed APIs using **AWS Lambda** combined with **API Gateway**, ensuring scalability and high performance.
* **Professional Application:** Applied academic knowledge of AI and programming to integrate AI models and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** techniques into the application.
* **NoSQL Database Management:** Used **Amazon DynamoDB** to store and retrieve user data quickly and efficiently.
* **Serverless Architecture Implementation:** Applied the Serverless model on AWS to optimize costs and scalability, utilizing AWS Lambda for compute and DynamoDB for the database.
* **Storage & Operations Management:** Used **Amazon S3** for static resource storage and established **CI/CD** processes to automate testing and application deployment.

Regarding attitude, I always maintained high focus, strictly adhered to regulations and corporate culture, and actively coordinated with team members to ensure project progress.

## 2. Detailed Self-Evaluation Matrix

| 12 | **Overall Evaluation** | Level of completion of internship goals. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |

## 3. Analysis of Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths Demonstrated

**1. Mastery of Core Technologies and Complex Business Logic Handling**
In charge of **AI Logic** for the project, I built processing flows for 4 core features: Tarot, Astrology, Numerology, and Horoscope. I feel confident in using **AWS Lambda** to write serverless processing functions and designing tables in **DynamoDB** to optimize data retrieval.
* *Highlight:* Especially with the "Horoscope" (Tử vi) feature – a difficult business problem due to complex knowledge of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches – I demonstrated strong **Research** capabilities by finding and successfully integrating an Open Source library into the system. This saved significant development time for the team while ensuring algorithm accuracy.
* I also applied **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** techniques to improve AI response capabilities, making the application smarter and more realistic.

**2. Proactiveness and Team Cohesion**
In the early stages, the group faced major process difficulties as members worked in silos, leading to task duplication and conflicts when merging code. Recognizing this issue, I proactively proposed reorganizing the workflow: setting up meetings to finalize tasks before implementation and updating progress regularly. As a result, the workflow became smoother. Additionally, I was always ready to support teammates in debugging (especially logic errors) and proactively took on arising tasks to ensure the whole team reached the finish line on time.

### Limitations & Lessons Learned

Besides the achieved results, I realize there are still points I need to overcome to improve myself:

* **Network & Security Knowledge:** Coming from an AI background, I was quite unfamiliar with AWS network infrastructure concepts such as **VPC, Security Group, Route Table** configurations, or authorization mechanisms (IAM Roles). Currently, I only know how to use them at a basic level and do not deeply understand the underlying security mechanisms. This is an area I need to invest in learning seriously in the near future.
* **Problem-solving Skills in Deadlocks:** Although proactive, there were times when the team debated without finding a solution, and I still spent too much time struggling before deciding to seek help (escalate) from the Mentor. The lesson I learned is to assess the situation faster and know how to leverage support at the right time to avoid delaying project progress.
* **Reporting Discipline:** Sometimes I was too focused on coding and neglected to update status on the management tool, or did not strictly adhere to standard corporate working hours. I understand that in a professional environment, discipline is as important as professional competence.

## 4. Conclusion and Development Orientation

The internship at **AWS First Cloud Journey** was a major turning point for me. From a student majoring in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, I found a new passion for **Cloud Computing**. The **SorcererXtreme** project showed me the power of combining AI with AWS's robust Cloud infrastructure to create highly scalable real-world applications.

**Orientation in the near future:**
* Continue to cultivate in-depth knowledge of **Backend & Cloud**, especially services related to Machine Learning on AWS.
* Learn more about **Frontend** to have a comprehensive view (Full-stack), better supporting the deployment of AI models to web applications.
* Set a goal to conquer AWS certifications to consolidate foundational knowledge and prepare for a future career path.

I would like to send my sincere thanks to the Mentors and teammates who accompanied and supported me in successfully completing this internship.
