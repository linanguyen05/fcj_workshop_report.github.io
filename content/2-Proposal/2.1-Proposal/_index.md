# SorcererXStreme: An AI-Powered Metaphysical Guidance Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

The SorcererXStreme AI platform is a unified AI-driven spiritual guidance system designed to help users explore self-discovery through various Eastern and Western esoteric disciplines, including Astrology, Tarot, Numerology, and Eastern Horoscopes. The foundation of the system is the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Core, which ensures all output is grounded in curated esoteric knowledge sources.


## 2. Problem Statement

### What’s the Problem?

Users currently face several limitations when exploring spiritual and esoteric knowledge:

*   **Fragmented and Unverified Information:** Information is scattered across the internet and often lacks credibility or proper cross-referencing.
*   **Difficulty in Cross-Discipline Comparison:** Results are hard to compare between Eastern (e.g., Eastern Horoscope) and Western (e.g., Astrology) schools of thought.
*   **Lack of Personalization and Interaction:** Most applications offer static readings, lacking the depth of personalized dialogue and contextual advice.
*   **Shallow Content:** Many "fun" apps lack intellectual depth and robust knowledge.

### The Solution

SorcererXStreme AI offers a unified, intuitive, and intelligent platform:

*   **Direct Interaction:** Users chat directly with AI Chatbot, asking anything about their personality, fate, or relationships.
*   **RAG-Grounded Interpretations:** The core RAG system guarantees that interpretations are based on verified esoteric data, ensuring accuracy and depth.
*   **Tiered User Experience:** Free and VIP tiers optimize the user experience and create a revenue stream.
*   **Cost-Efficient Design:** A modern, lightweight design rapidly deployed on a cost-optimized AWS serverless architecture.

## Services Used

| Layer | Service | Role and Relationship |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Edge & Auth** | Amplify, Cognito | - Amplify handles frontend hosting and routing.<br>- Cognito manages authentication. |
| **API & Routing** | API Gateway | - The primary endpoint for all Backend Lambdas and AI Lambdas. |
| **Compute Layer** | AWS Lambda | - Processes Business Logic and Async/Sync flows. |
| **Data & Integration** | DynamoDB, Parameter Store, NeonDB, Pinecone | - NeonDB (external PostgreSQL) is the Primary DB.<br>- DynamoDB for history/quick access.<br>- Parameter Store for secure storage. |
| **AI/ML** | Bedrock, Lambda (Embeddings), S3 | - Bedrock (LLM Model).<br>- S3 stores raw RAG documents.<br>- Lambda Embeddings creates vectors. |
| **Async & Monitoring** | EventBridge, SQS, SES, CloudWatch, SNS | - Handles Asynchronous flows and Independent Monitoring activities. |
| **DevOps** | GitHub Actions, CloudFormation | - GitHub Actions handles Build and Test process, and CloudFormation generated by the Serverless Framework is the main deployment tool. |


## Workflow

### 1. Real-time API Interaction Flow (Synchronous Flow)

This flow handles direct chat and interpretation requests from the user.

  * **(1) Request Reception:** The User sends a request directly to the AWS Amplify Endpoint.
  * **(2) Routing & API:** Amplify forwards the request to API Gateway. API Gateway authenticates the Cognito token and routes to the corresponding Lambda (`SyncUser`, `Chatbot`, etc.).
  * **(3) Data Processing:** Lambda accesses Parameter Store for secrets and retrieves data from NeonDB, DynamoDB.
  * **(4) RAG and AI:** The Chatbot Lambda executes the RAG flow:
      * Uses Bedrock (Embedding Model) to create a vector for the question.
      * Queries Pinecone (Vector Database) using that vector.
      * Sends the RAG context to Bedrock (LLM) to generate the answer.
  * **(5) Response:** Lambda returns the result to API Gateway -> Amplify -> User.

### 2. Automated Notification Flow (Asynchronous Flow)

This flow is simplified and does not require RDS.

  * **(1) Trigger:** EventBridge Scheduler triggers the `TriggerReminder` Lambda.
  * **(2) Data Query:** Lambda queries DynamoDB or NeonDB to retrieve the list of subscribed users.
  * **(3) Distribution:** Lambda generates content and sends emails via Amazon SES.


### 3. Deployment Flow (DevOps)

  * **(1) Code Commit:** Developer pushes code to GitHub.
  * **(2) Build & Deploy:** GitHub Actions triggers the Build, Test process and uses CloudFormation generated by the Serverless Framework to deploy Lambdas, API Gateway, and other resources to AWS.


## 5. Timeline & Milestones

The SorcererXStreme project will be executed over a 9-week concentrated development period using an Agile-Iterative model to quickly deliver an MVP with key features.
